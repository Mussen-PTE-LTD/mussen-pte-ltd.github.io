Millions of people around the world switched off lights in homes, offices and famous landmarks at 8.30pm local time for an hour on Saturday to mark WWF's annual Earth Hour. Now in its eighth year, the mass participation event to show support for environmental issues comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change prepares to launch its latest report in Japan on Monday, outlining how global warming will affect wildlife, food supplies, water and the weather.

Among the world's famous landmarks that will dim their lights are the Empire State building in New York, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow, the Bosphorus Bridge in Turkey, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and Marina Bay in Singapore.

Spider-Man, Earth Hourâ€™s first-ever Super Hero Ambassador, was in Singapore! See what you may have missed [here](http://earthhour.wwf.sg/2014/event/).
